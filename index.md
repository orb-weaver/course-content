## Module3 - Introduction to JavaScript

These activities cover an introduction to writing programs using JavaScript

* [A brief history of JavaScript](?md=/course-content/module3/a_brief_history_of_javascript.md) -
  JavaScript has gone from a relatively minor technology to add animations and
  other basic interaction to web pages, to a full-featured envionment that can
  be used to write complex applications
* [Introduction to Programming with JavaScript](?md=/course-content/module3/introduction_to_javascript.md) -
  Covers the basics of writing computer programs, and the basic constructs of
  the JavaScript language
* [Working with Functions](?md=/course-content/module3/working_with_functions.md) -
  Unleash the power of JavaScript with functions!
* [Best Practices](?md=/course-content/module3/best_practices.md) -
  Before getting too deep into the dark reaches of the language, it might be
  helpful to step back a bit and think about some acknowledged best practices
* [Debugging Resources](?md=/course-content/module3/debugging_resources.md) -
  Code usually doesn't work right the first time - this covers some techniques
  for finding, diagnosing, and fixing issues.
* [Object Modeling Practice](?md=/course-content/module3/object_modeling_practice.md) -
  Basic exercises to work on representing information in code.
* [Wrapup and Refresher](?md=/course-content/module3/javascript_refresher.md) -
  Quick overview of the concepts covered up to this point.

## Module4 - Applied JavaScript

This section expands on the previous activities to write useful functions with
JavaScript

* [Host Objects](?md=/course-content/module4/host_objects.md) -
  The JavaScript runtime within web browsers and other environments provides
  built-in objects to perform common tasks and have access to the current
  environment.
* [Using jQuery](?md=/course-content/module4/using_jquery.md) -
  jQuery is the de-facto standard API for manipulating the DOM using JavaScript
* [Event Handling](?md=/course-content/module4/event_handling.md) -
  Responding to user input and actions is a key part of making pages and
  applications that can interact with the user.
* [jQuery Exercises](?md=/course-content/module4/jquery_exercises.md) -
  A collection of exercises to practice common jQuery patterns.
* [Accessing Server Resources](?md=/course-content/module4/accessing_server_resources.md) -
  Up to this point we've been dealing with one half of the web application
  landscape - almost all applications will also need to access resources that
  are provided by separate server instance
* [Creating Objects and Modules](?md=/course-content/module4/creating_objects_and_modules.md) -
  Objects are a great way to organize code so it is easier to test and
  maintain.
* [JavaScript Frameworks](?md=/course-content/module4/javascript_frameworks.md) -
  JavaScript frameworks are a dime a dozen, but many exist to fill in or improve
  on shortcomings of the underlying runtime environment

## Module6 - Thinking Like a Developer

* [Unit Testing](?md=/course-content/module6/unit_testing.md) -
  Writing automated tests for JavaScript applications is an essential part
  of creating robust and maintainable applications.
